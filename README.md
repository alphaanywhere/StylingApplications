<style>A series webinars on styling applications in Alpha Anywhere</style>


### Part 1 - March 6, 2019

The first installmetn of a series of webinars on styling applications. In part 1, we start at the beginning. We discuss what an application _is_, define CSS, give a high-level overview of [Combinators]() with a deep-ish dive into the [_.classname_ combinator](), breifly touch on Alpha Web Themes (what they are), and go through a demonstration of how to style buttons in a UX separately from the core web theme. 

Links coming soon!

### Part 2 - March 27, 2019

In part 2, we take a look at using Style Tweaks to modify a system style - Alpha - and taking a look at how you might approach building up a set of Style Tweaks to modify the style for a project. We also talk about [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables and nesting - a technique for grouping [descendent combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator) with the same parent.
